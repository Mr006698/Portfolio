    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>From the moment I first programmed my ZX Spectrum as a child, I have been fascinated by the possibilities of
      technology. From building radio-controlled aircraft to crafting FM radio transmitters (If I was not taking my mums
      hoover apart!). This early passion started a lifelong journey into the world of electrical-mechanical engineering,
      CNC control systems and industrial robots. All while continuing my obsession with software development and
      programming languages.
      Throughout my professional career, I have honed my critical thinking skills and cultivated a deep understanding of
      both hardware and software systems. My experience in electrical and mechanical engineering provided a solid
      foundation for logical thinking and problem solving, which seamlessly transitioned into programming and
      application
      development.</p>
